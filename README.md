this is the frontend of a basic e-commerce website

E Commerce Site

Technology: HTML CSS VANILLA JAVASCRIPT

Challenge: 
To build a prototype of a womenâ€™s e-commerce site. Build it with no frontend framework. Browser support of 95% or higher. The page needs to be responsive. Also it needed to display the cart items added. Basic UI filter behavior is also needed. 

Outcome: 
This was easy but not simple. I really needed a way to make my code reusable and clean without using frameworks. This process saves countless hours of going back changing things that the client might have issue with here or there visually. 

Understanding modular patterns came in handy. CSS selection were name strategically and style based on its purpose on the page. I made sure I use responsive width throughout the design, so that my page accommodate all screens. JavaScript was use to add a cart functionality when customer click on items.
